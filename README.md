# TCC-Plane-of-array
Graduation Final Project on electrical engineering at PUC-Rio university.

My final graduation project in Electrical Engineering at PUC-Rio University involved two key tasks. Firstly, I utilized Python code to handle irradiance outliers in meteorological data through non-linear regression (from scipy curve_fit function), employing functions from the pvlib library to calculate the plane of the array. Secondly, I compared these plane of array results with simulations using the Perez Model in PVsyst and the Perez and Hay-Davies Models in HelioScope.

Additionally, I wrote a final paper titled "TCC Rafael Vilela Santa Rosa.pdf".
